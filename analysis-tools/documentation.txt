This directory contains (or will contain) a collection of tools for analyzing, fformatting, and visualizing antenna pattern measurments.



Summary of Tools
****************

plotPoincare.m
*   Matlab script to plot orthogonal field measurments on a Poincare sphere to
*   visualize polarization.






Detailed Listing
****************

plotPoincare.m
*   Matlab function
*   plotPoincare(MagX, MagY, DeltaPhase [, OpaqueSphere[, ShowLabels]])
*   
*   Plots a point or vector of points on a Poincare sphere for
*   easy visualization of the points' polarization.
*   
*   X and Y must be two perpendicular measurements of the field, with MagX
*   and MagY being the fields' magnitudes and DeltaPhase being the
*   difference in their phases in degrees (PhaseY - PhaseX).
*
*   OpaqueSphere is an optional argument which determines if the sphere is
*   opaque (points on the back are hidden) or transparent (see-through wire
*   frame) If not specified, it defaults to false (transparent).
*   
*   ShowLabels is an optional argument which sets whether or not to include
*   text labels on the sphere denoting six special case polarizations:
*   left- and right-handed circular; vertical, horizontal, and +/-45
*   degree (slant) linear. If not specified, it defaults to true.
